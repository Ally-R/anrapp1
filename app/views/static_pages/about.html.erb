  <h1>About Ally's XWP Review</h1>
  <p>Hi! Welcome to my comprehensive (and in-progress) review of the best TV show of all time, Xena: Warrior Princess. This page contains a bit about the inspiration for this website, as well as what you can find on it and how to navigate it. </p>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>
  Aren't we all inspired by Xena? My journey with the great Warrior Princess began when I was in high school, floundering in a world of TV. I mindlessly consumed the first eight or more episodes without much interest... and then, around the time of <q>The Black Wolf</q>, things had begun to change. By <q>Warrior... Princess</q>, I was fully invested. And after six seasons, I had come to discover a show like no other: so deep and rich, yet eternally playful. A show that stays true to itself at every turn. A show that explores love, life, and morality with a powerful mix of graceful subtelty and campy absurdity. This show has a living soul, and one that matches mine to an astonishing degree. Which is why I'm writing this.

<h3>This website</h3>
<p>
  On this website, you can find (or will, eventually) every episode and my thoughts on it, all of the characters I have deemed worthy of sharing my thoughts about, and a random Xena quote generator... so far. These pages are works in progress, and I hope to add more pages at some point as well.
