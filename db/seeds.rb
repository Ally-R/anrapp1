This is because she clearly fits the archetype of `inverse of main character` that is so tired and overdone. While Callisto is great, Hudson is an incredible actor, and both are rightly beloved, the actual conception of the character from a unique storybuilding standpoint has a significant element of failure.", sources: "None."}, {title: "Plot devices -- Gabrielle's Unbelievable Pain", season: 6, episode: 4, response_to: "A trend I noticed...", comment: "Ever notice how some of the gutwrenching episodes of this show hinge upon a completely out-of-nowhere death in Gabrielle's family that takes a lot of suspension of disbelief to accept as character-consistent? Think `Who's Gurkhan`, `Return of Callisto`...", sources: "None."}, {title: "Hope a creation of Xena's fear?", season: 3, episode: 4, response_to: "Narrative of natural evil Hope", comment: "Hope, the evil spawn of Dahak and Gabrielle, may not be so evil. The series plays with the character of Hope, showing her evil as a baby (strangling that soldier) and throughout life--but they also show some humanity, how she cares what Gabrielle thinks of her, how she cares for her son. But hope remains an evil player despite these vulnerable moments. My question: Was this really inevitable, or shaped by Xena's early hate for the child and fear of Hope's evil? Many consider this impossible due to the initial killing of the solider, but even this is quiestionable to me. I mean, if you had super powers as an infant and no sense of life and morality yet, as none of us do at that age, what's the chance you wouldn't accidentially hurt someone? Can we really determine any core feature of a being by the way they act as a newborn?", sources: "None."}, {title: "The Worst Episode", season: 5, episode: 10, response_to: "Terrible floating red skies of nowhere", comment: "Lyre, Lyre, Hearts on Fire is the worst episode of Xena: Warrior Princess. Sure, there are less engaging episodes, and more frustrating ones, but none so incomprehensible as this one. What I care about, however, is *why*. The answer is simple: It's the 100th episode! Celebration! The whole team clearly had fun with this one, and it cost them all coherenc.", sources: "Xena Warrior Podcast with Katie, Vera, and Livy"}, {title: "Warrior... Princess: The First Taste of True Xena", season: 1, episode: 15, response_to: "The question of when the show finds its footing", comment: "The first repeat episode structure and style that is echoed as far out as Season 3, the first taste of pure Xena comedy, the introduction of Diana and Burger King[1], all this and more is the reason why `Warrior... Princess` is the first episode where the show comes into itself.", sources: "[1]Xena Warrior Podcast with Katie, Vera, and Livy"}])
