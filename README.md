## Ruby on Rails Development Skills (Portfolio question 4.4)
This site illustrates the many technical skills I have learned about development with Ruby on Rails, as well as my overall proficiency in designing and implementing a cohesive site. These include linking pages with a common navbar at the top, creating partials for the header and footer, displaying images with embedded Ruby, using hash tables and embedded Ruby loops to display content in a repetitive layout, randomization in Rails, and creating databases and forms linked to them. Overall, my personal site contains a significant amount and variety of Rails features, which individually showcase the technical skills I have gained in Rails development, and together (along with the HTML/CSS) demonstrate my newfound skills in cohesive website development.
